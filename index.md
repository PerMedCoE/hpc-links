# Links to HPC centre documentation

This page collects together general information and resources for working with different computing clusters hosted by HPC centres and universities affiliated with [PerMedCoE](https://permedcoe.eu/).

The page is split into three sections:

- [General links to user documentation](#General-links-to-user-documentation)
- [Links split by topics](#Links-split-by-topics)
- [Tutorial on working with computing clusters](#Tutorial-on-working-with-computing-clusters)

A non-exhaustive list of computing clusters and their hosts:

- BSC: MareNostrum4, CTE-ARM, CTE-Power, CTE-AMD
- CSC: Mahti, Puhti, LUMI
- The University of Luxembourg: Aion, Iris
